**Code Readability:** Add comments throughout the code, use more meaningful variables than `i`, `j`, and `dp`. When working with the matrix, use `row` and `col` instead. Remove the debugging code; in this case, the `print` statements.

**Task Implementation:** The assignment states that it's necessary to only count the number of operations required to convert one word to another, so the last part of the code can either be omitted or used only in debug mode, for example by passing a variable called "debug" which would default to False.

**Function Decomposition:** The function `minimal_distance` is quite large, and for the convenience of testing and readability, it would be better to split it into smaller ones, for example:
- initializing the DP matrix
- performing the DP calculations
- reconstructing the edits

**Save Calculations Result:** For the `get_dp` function, you can incorporate result caching using `lru_cache` to avoid recalculating for identical values.

**Loop Optimization:** In the loop, only the previous and current row of the matrix is always used, so in order to avoid storing the entire matrix, you can limit it to just the previous and current rows. For step-by-step string reconstruction, it will be necessary to store the sequence of operations.

**Code Problems**: 
 - The algorithm functions correctly for equal string lengths and when the first letters match. 
 - Function `range` have to work till `n+1` and `m+1`
 - There is unreachable code in the `get_dp` method, the method itself is unnecessary. 
 - There's an error in string concatenation using slices in the `insert_into_array` method.
 - Considering the line `distance = get_dp(n-1, m-1)`, the last iteration in the loop is also unnecessary.
 - Add typing for functions
